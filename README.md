# LinkedIn Dark Mode (Gleyson)

link: https://dask-model-linkedin.vercel.app/

I decided to improve my knowledge of the latest version of Next13, better understanding the functioning of server and client components, as well as exploring new features.

With this in mind, I decided to create the LinkedIn profile section from scratch, incorporating a dark mode theme. In the process, I also created some components with a more modern appearance.

The ultimate goal is to turn it into a comprehensive portfolio that showcases my experience and allows me to tell my professional story in a unique way.
